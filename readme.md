# Das2 Meta data

This area is intended for additional information which the Das2 libraries can use 
for processing.  Created to host the orbits files which enumerate interesting 
intervals for missions, there may be other non-code (non-binary) files which 
are housed here.

## PSP-Orbits

These were originally committed to [autoplot/orbits](https://github.com/autoplot/orbits/tree/main/psp)
by [Kristoff Paulson](https://github.com/kpaulson) a couple years ago and 
likely need updates.  The upstream source at that time was:
