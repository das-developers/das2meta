# Das2 Meta data

This area is intended for additional information which the Das2 libraries can use 
for processing.  Created to host the orbits files which enumerate interesting 
intervals for missions, there may be other non-code (non-binary) files which 
are housed here.

## RBSP Orbits
The two orbits files from the Van Allen Probes mission were copied from https://space.physics.uiowa.edu/plasma-wave/rbsp/orbits/.  The
Das2 code still uses these and they are only for reference, until the code is updated.  When this happens, this text should be 
updated.

## PSP Orbits

These were originally committed to [autoplot/orbits](https://github.com/autoplot/orbits/tree/main/psp)
by [Kristoff Paulson](https://github.com/kpaulson) a couple years ago and 
likely need updates.  The upstream source at that time was:
